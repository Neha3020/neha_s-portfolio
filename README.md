# Regional Sales Analysis 

### Project Overview 
---

This project focuses on analyzing and comparing sales performance across two selected regions using Tableau. The objective is to present key metrics such as total sales, average sales per order, customer count, and product diversity. The dashboard created will support strategic decisions by providing actionable insights through data visualization.

### Data sources
The primary dataset is used for this analysis is the  "sample---superstore.csv" file , containing details information about each sale made by the store .

### tool is used

### Data Cleaning/prepartion 

In the intial data prepartion phase , we performed the following tasks :
1. Data loading inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formating

### Exploratry Data Analysis

As a data analyst, your task is to keep the upper management and regional teams 
updated on the sales performance. Create a dashboard using Tableau for the 
organization's communication platform. 
  ### Action 
1. Sales Performance Parameters: 
• Create a parameter for the Primary Region and another for the 
Secondary Region to allow region selection, listing all regions in them 
• Create calculated fields to filter the data based on the selected regions 
• Display the total sales for each region, using separate worksheets for the 
primary and secondary regions 
2. Average Sales and Order Statistics: 
• Create a worksheet showing the average sales per order for both the 
primary and secondary regions 
• Include a count of the total number of orders in each region 
• Filter each worksheet to display data only for the selected region 
3. Customer and Product Analysis: 
• Create a worksheet displaying the number of unique customers in each 
region 
• Create a worksheet showing the number of distinct products sold in 
each region 
• Apply filters to each worksheet to ensure data accuracy for the selected 
regions 
4. Comparative Analysis: 
• Combine the individual worksheets into a single dashboard 
• Use containers to partition the dashboard into sections for the primary 
and secondary regions 
• Add parameter controls to allow users to select different regions and 
dynamically update the visualizations

### Implication:
West may benefit from a broader customer base and product variety, while South may focus on improving order volume and customer reach.
•	West outperforms South in nearly all metrics, particularly in order volume and product range.
•	South has a slightly higher average sale per order, indicating fewer but potentially higher-value purchases.
•	Strategic Recommendation: The South region should focus on expanding customer reach and diversifying the product portfolio to match West's performance.
